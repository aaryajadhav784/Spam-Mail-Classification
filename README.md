# Email Spam Classification Application

This is a **Machine Learning** application built to classify emails as **Ham** (Not Spam) or **Spam**. It uses a pre-trained classification model to analyze email content and predict whether the email is legitimate or unsolicited.

## Project Description

Email spam classification is a critical task to filter out unwanted emails from users' inboxes. This application utilizes a machine learning model to classify email messages based on their content. It identifies spam emails by detecting patterns, keywords, and structures commonly found in spam emails (such as promotions, urgent offers, or deceptive language). 

### Key Features:
- **Spam Classification:** Classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on the content entered.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and interactive web interface to input the email text.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Classifies the email content in real-time as users enter it.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user enters the content of an email into the input box.
2. **Preprocessing:** The application preprocesses the email text by removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing words.
3. **Feature Extraction:** The text is converted into numerical features that the machine learning model can understand.
4. **Model Prediction:** The trained machine learning model predicts whether the email is **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on its content.
5. **Result Display:** The result is shown in the interface as either "This is a Spam Email" (red) or "This is Not a Spam Email" (green).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Built using **Streamlit** for creating a simple, interactive web interface.
- **Backend:** Machine Learning model (e.g., **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine**) to classify the emails.
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - **Streamlit:** For web interface.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model training and prediction.
  - **Pandas, Numpy:** For data manipulation and processing.
